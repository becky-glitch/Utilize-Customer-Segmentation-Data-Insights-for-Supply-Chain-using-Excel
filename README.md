### Business Problem
SmartHome Solutions Inc. faces a significant challenge in optimizing its supply chain and production planning. The traditional approach to production planning, based primarily on historical data and market forecasts, poses various obstacles:

- Inefficient Production: Relying on historical data often results in overproduction or underproduction, causing operational inefficiencies and increased costs.

- Customer Disconnection: The company lacks a deep understanding of its diverse customer base, making it challenging to align production with specific customer demands.

- Inventory Management: Inefficient production planning has led to excess inventory, tying up valuable resources and impacting the company's profitability

### Business Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

- Customer Segmentation: To segment and profile SmartHome Solutions Inc.'s customer base to gain insights into their preferences, buying behaviors, and geographic distribution.

- Data-Driven Planning: To enhance production planning, inventory management, and distribution strategies based on customer segments, thereby reducing overproduction and minimizing excess inventory.

- Customer-Centric Approach: To improve on-time deliveries, increase customer satisfaction, and align production with customer demands.

 ### Process Taken

- Data Cleaning and Preparation

Consolidate Data: Import and consolidate these datasets into Excel.

Clean Data: Check for and handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Data Transformation: Format and transform data as needed for analysis (e.g., date formatting, categorical data encoding).

STEPS

1. Checking for Missing Values

   - Open your Excel dataset.

   - Select the range of data or the entire sheet.

   - Go to the 'Home' tab, click on 'Find & Select', and choose 'Go To Special'.

   - Select 'Blanks' and click 'OK'. This will highlight all cells that are empty.

2. Find and Remove Duplicates

   - Select the range of data or the entire sheet.

   - Go to the 'Data' tab and click on 'Remove Duplicates'.

   - Choose the columns to check for duplicates, then click 'OK'.

3. Data Transformation

   - Converting Text to Dates:

   - Using the =text(), to split the timestamp columns to date and time.

   - Then using the datevalue() to ensure that they are in the date data type.

4. Checking Data Types

   - Excel doesn't explicitly show data types like a programming language, but you can infer:

   - Numbers are right-aligned by default.

   - Texts are left-aligned.

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel: Data Cleaning and validation.
- Microsoft Excel: Dashboard and visualization
